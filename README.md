# Software Development Plan

### Purpose

------

The purpose of this app is to replicate the connect four game into a digital format within the terminal of a computer.



### Scope

------

Objective

In this current age, many of our forms of hard-copy media like books, newspapers, magazines, movies, shows and photos have transitioned into digital format. There are a few reasons for this transition to have occurred, with some of the reasoning that it is more convenient to store and there is an increase in ease of accessibility. It only stands to say that board games would fall into this category as well.



Audience

The audience is anyone who wishes to play a game of connect four. As a casual board game, the audience for this app isn't clearly defined since it's play time is not long.



Use of the app

As the app is opened up, it asks if you wish to play with a friend or against the AI. This launches the desired game mode of connect four.

#### How to play

------

Connect four is a very simple game which can last up to 42 moves and end up in a draw. The board layout comprises of 7 columns and 6 rows, with the players taking turns to drop a piece into a column. Pieces stack on top of one another so there may only be a singular piece within a spot of the board. Whichever player connects four individual pieces together (vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins).

*Hint: the player that starts off with the centre column can force a win!*

##### Features

##### Artificial Intelligence
