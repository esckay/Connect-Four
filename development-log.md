Having decided that connect 4 would be a fun and enjoyable project/game to work on delved into the maths behind the game. Found a lot of interesting information however did not apply it all to this app. Finished coding the player vs player side of the game as this was the simpler side of the project. Didn't encounter too many difficulties with the basics of this code however still have to look at cleaning the representation of the board

**5/07**

Bit more research into AI logic of connect 4 and was able to finish the code off. Changing game-modes within the app did cause me a few moments of wondering what happened however that has been cleaned up and is functioning as in tented. Cleaning up the main flow of the app and finishing off log/readme files left to do. Installer part of python to be completed as well
